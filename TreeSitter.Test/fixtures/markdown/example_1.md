# Welcome to Markdown!

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

## Basic Formatting

You can easily add **bold** text, *italic* text, or even ***combined*** emphasis. Need to strike through something? Use ~~two tildes~~.

You can also use `inline code` for quick snippets.

## Lists

### Unordered List:
*   First item
*   Second item
    *   You can nest lists by indenting.
*   Third item

### Ordered List:
1.  First ordered item
2.  Second item
3.  Third item
    1.  Nested ordered list.
    2.  Another nested item.

## Links and Images

Here is an [example link](https://www.example.com) to a website.

Here is an image (note: actual rendering depends on the image URL and platform support):
![Alt text for the image](https://example.com/image.jpg "Optional title")

## Blockquotes

> Markdown uses email-style characters for blockquoting.
> > You can even nest blockquotes.

## Code Blocks

Use three backticks (\`\`\`) to create fenced code blocks for multiple lines of code, with optional syntax highlighting:

\`\`\`python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
\`\`\`

## Tables

Tables are an extended syntax feature and are great for organizing data.
